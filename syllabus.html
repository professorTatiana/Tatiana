    Presentation:<br>
</h3>
<h4>
    There will be a one-course presentation. This presentation has two goals. The first goal<br>
is to help you learn more about doing research in general. The second goal is to give<br>
you the opportunity to study a particular area of OS in greater detail. Therefore, you<br>
are expected to perform a substantial research presentation.
Remember, the best<br> presentation for you is the one you feel motivated to do. <br>I hope you can
learn a lot from this presentation and get a lot of fun too!

    Grading and Policies
<br>                                                
● The exams may test on the material covered only in class and on material covered only
in the reading assignments.<br>
● Your grade will be based approximately, as follows. These percentages are tentative and
subject to change.<br>
15% - Homeworks/GroupWork<br>
15% - Participation(Discussions)<br>
20% - Presentation<br>
20% - Midterm Exam<br>
30% - Final<br>
It is usually expected that students will spend approximately 2 hours of study time<br>
outside of class for every one hour in class. Since this is a 3 credit class, you should<br>
expect to study an average of 6 hours outside of class each week.<br>

● Class participation is essential to succeed in this course.<br>
● DO NOT USE pencils to write down your solutions for the homework, project, or exams; if<br>
you decide, however, to use a pencil do not complain about grading. (for face to face
classes)<br>
● Check the marks in a homework, project, or exam and report errors promptly. Make sure<br>
you report such problems to the instructor within four weeks from receipt but no later than<br>
May 18, 2021. If you believe a grade you received is not representative of your effort talk
to the instructor.<br>
● Homework assignments are due at the start of class on their due date. If you think you<br>
won&#39;t be present in class on that Monday turn the homework in earlier at the instructor&#39;s
office or by email.<br>
● No later solutions will be taken into consideration!<br>
● The work you turn in MUST BE your own personal work, composed and written by you.<br>
No plagiarism. Otherwise, you will get a grade of zero for the homework or project.<br>
● DO NOT OBTAIN YOUR SOLUTION THROUGH THE INTERNET. Or you will get a<br>
grade of zero for the homework or project.<br>
● The collaboration of any kind is NOT allowed in the in-class exams (midterms, and final).<br>
